# GreenDream
Wireless + smart irrigation for at-home needs.

On average, a homeowner with plants kills 7 potted plants every single year, whether it be from over-watering or not watering the plants enough. GreenDream is a smart-irrigation-system (SIS) that warns you when you need to water your plants and automates the process.

There are a billion of these on the market and in DIY STEM fairs, so what makes GD unique?
* Wireless plant sensors (plug in as many as you want)
* Centralized plant dashboard
* Customizable watering thresholds
* Scalable to all the needs of your house
* Logging and analytics of watering



FUTURE FEATURES (?):
- AI predictions
- Automated watering
- Upgrade LCD screen (???)
